### Day 1: Sept 01, 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've went through week 1 of EDx's course: [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2020a/course/).

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and I found it very challenging to do problem set 1. The biggest takeaway is to take these lectures when I'm awake and orientated, not awake and super tired from being up for more than 22 hours. Am I allowed to share the solutions to Edx assignments? Probably not, no links today.

### Day 2: September 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started the Odin Project (The Basics, Installation, Git Basics) as well as Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming

**Thoughts:** At first I felt very overwhelmed "am I actually doing this?" but then I gave it a shot. I found command line and git to not be as hard as I thought it would be! Looking forward to to doing the Front End section of the Odin Project.

### Day 3: September 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I was moreso focusing on studying Git Basics and command lines. Just practicing. Feeling a lot more comfortable. I read a link and watched the two youtube videos in the link.

**Thoughts:** Not as scary as I thought :)

### Day 4: September 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed FreeCodeCamp's Basic CSS section. 

**Thoughts:** CSS is interesting and I get the fact that it's the UI or user's view that is being changed, not the main core or content of information.

### Day 5: September 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I completed FreeCodeCamp's Applied Visual Design

**Thoughts:** Pretty straightforward, however I do not think I can remember everything by heart. If I make things, I might need a quick reference.

**Link to work:** [Applied Visual Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/)

### Day 6: September 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did sections 8-10 from Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming and some of the FreeCodeCamp sections for Responsive Web Design Certiification.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm ok with having some days off, not to break the rules and be like oh haha time to avoid restarting, but more like I need a mental health day for other various reasons and having this counter restart is lame and makes me feel bad.

### Day 7: September 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the last few sections from the Responsive Web Design Certification excluding the project section. 

**Thoughts:** VERY NERVOUS AND AT THE SAME TIME EXCITED ABOUT THE FACT THAT TOMORROW WILL BE THE START OF THE PROJECTS AHH.

### Day 8: September 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I took today as a project to focus on my first ever game jam lol. It was the low effort one and I learned how to use Renpy and made a quick prototype of a game. 

**Thoughts:** I was very nervous about it, but since it was a low effort game jam, I figured I would give it a go and get some experience from it. Renpy is really cool, but I have a hard time understanding how to upload it onto itch.io as a web browser game.

### Day 9: September 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I attempted a gam jam and learned a little bit of the GODOT software. Failed to make a game or something in 3 hours.

**Thoughts:** I was very nervous about it and had high hopes since I completed the other game jam. Boy was I in for a treat. I did not get a game to be made, but I understood high level what needed to be done. I shouldn't jump the gun and try to make a 3D platformer after learning how to use RenPy. LOL. I'll stick to learning with FreeCodeCamp and Odin for right now and slowly learn how to use other things like RenPy and GODOT without such a timecrunch to make a product.

### Day 10: September 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Build a Tribute Page assignment. Joined a jam that will last 6 days

**Thoughts:** I thought it was very simple enough. I hate how I cannot remember all the stuff for each element, but at least I know how to do it :) I joined a jam today that's meant for all and has stuff for beginners. Thinking about what idea sounds good for the theme today, I hope to start on it tomorrow.

### Day 11: September 13, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I finished the Build a Survey Form assignment. Learning how to use Construct 3 for my game jam

**Thoughts:** I thought it was very simple enough. I feel like I need a better understanding of CSS. I feel so bad about how my assignment doesn't look as nice as the example one. It passes all the tests, but I don't have like bootstrap or anything on it. In regards to the game jam, Construct 3 looks good. It's just a bit tedious and the whole designing the level aspect is also very scary. I'm learning a lot though!

### Day 12: September 14, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I finished the Build a Product Landing Page assignment. 

**Thoughts:** This one was tough! Specifically the form portion. I decided not to make it super pretty or even dress it up as I have bigger fish to fry: finishing a game to submit on Wednesday night!

### Day 13: September 22, 2020
**Today's Progress**: I finished the Technical Documentation Page and Personal Portfolio Webpage.

**Thoughts:** I had a horrible week between September 14 - September 22. I wanted to push the last two assignments out. Are they ugly? Yes. Do they get the job done? Yes. Anyhow, I'm glad I didn't give up.

### Day 14: September 27, 2020
**Today's Progress:** I finished The Odin Project's HTML/CSS project. Easy version.

**Thoughts:** I know I'm taking breaks in between but I am dedicated to at least do 100 days some how. Not going to lie, I have a bit of an inferiority complex when it comes to coding. I feared to finish this project or even start, thinking I'm not smart enough. I'm glad I did it and finished it and not quit.

### Day 15: September 30, 2020
**Today's Progress:** I finished reading and doing Web Development 101's JavaScript Basics (Fundamentals 1) and the HTMl/CSS Hard Version.

**Thoughts:** Hard version was difficult because I wanted it to be perfect, but I settled for enough to complete the assignment without 500% polish. In regards to JavaScrip basics, it feels like a refresher from other things, but with slightly different information in language. I am excited to relearn JavaScript. I learned it before the let and const, only had var. So this is super exciting!

### Day 16: October 2, 2020
**Today's Progress:** I finished reading Web Development 101's JavaScript Basics (Fundamentals 2-3)

**Thoughts:** None really

### Day 17: October 3, 2020
**Today's Progress:** I finished reading and doing Web Development 101's Problem Solving

**Thoughts:** I'm a bit nervous about progrmaming and learning how to do things to solve actual problems. I feel like I'm going to need a bit more videos to boost my confidence and more understanding on JavaScript fundamentals before I do the Rock Paper Scissors Project.

### Day 18: October 4, 2020
**Today's Progress:** I finished doing the pseudocode for rock paper scissors assignment for The Odin Project

**Thoughts:** I am absolutely horrified and scared of solving problems with programming. I feel like it's me just feeling very inadequate, so I made sure to take super small baby steps. Pseudocode!!! Tomorrow I'll probably finish the assignment when I have time outside of work.

### Day 19: October 5, 2020
**Today's Progress:** I finished doing the rock paper scissors assignment for The Odin Project! It works on console! 

**Thoughts:** I had all the logic and everything (thanks to the pseudocode I write and grilled to make sure it worked). I needed help and since I got confused with TOP's debugger note. I thought that was the template for the assignment, so I moved it around and then made it. Had to use console.log a few times to debug :)

### Day 20: October 6, 2020
**Today's Progress:** I finished reading the Odin Project's Clean Code and Fundamentals Part 4. Cleaned the code up for rock paper scissors.

**Thoughts:** I tried to read the DOM manipulation, but it seems to go over my head a little bit. I'll attempt to find another way to learn about DOM manipulation outside of TOP and then do the assignment with it.

### Day 21: October 8, 2020
**Today's Progress:** I finished reading the Odin Project's DOM Manipulation (reading only)

**Thoughts:** I tried to read the DOM manipulation, it took a lot longer to read and understand little by little. I plan on changing my rock paper scissors as asked on the DOM manipulation page over the weekend.

### Day 22: October 9, 2020
**Today's Progress:** I finished reading the Odin Project's DOM Manipulation practices!

**Thoughts:** I refused to revamp it, being lazy this time around. But I did do everything as required to spec. pasta code I guess but I'm very happy about me actually finishing :)

### Day 23: October 12, 2020
**Today's Progress:** I started the Etch-a-Sketch project

**Thoughts:** I read it and am going to break it down one by one for the assignment. I wanted to make the skeleton today, tomorrow will be the JavaScript grid, next day hover stuff ,etc.

### Day 24: October 13, 2020
**Today's Progress:** I added to the Etch-a-Sketch project

**Thoughts:** I made JavaScript be able to add based on calling tableIt(). what is next on the immediate to do list: CSS variables to dynamically change the width and height of .grid-row and .grid-column to fill up the whole space for the container. \
next would be figuring out to default on window loadscreen make a 16x16 grid. \
3rd would be figuring out on:hover \
    a. change the color while hovering and after to black. \
    b. same with step a, but with a radio selection (that isn't random). \
    c. same as step b., but with random
